# Basic-Cryptography-in-Python

This repository contains samples of basic cryptographic concepts implemented in Python. 

A few example of the programs you will find here, but not all, are:

1. Caesar Cipher:
A Caesar cipher algorithm that takes a plaintext message and shifts the letters by a certain number of positions in the alphabet to create a ciphertext message.
2. Ceasar Brute Forcing:
Implements an brute forcing algorithm that decrypts a Caesar cipher by systematically trying all possible shift values until the correct one is found.
3. One-Time Pad:
An algorithm that uses a randomly generated key that is at least as long as the message being encrypted to produce ciphertext that will require the key, with which it has been encrypted to decrypt the message (ciphertext).
